# Firmware Update Process for TNC3 on Microsoft Windows 10

This document outlines the firmware update process for the Mobilinkd TNC3
for Microsoft Window, focusing on Windows 10.  The update process should
be similar enough for all Windows versions back to Windows 7.

Please note that the firmware update software is cross-platform, so the
actual firmware update process is the same for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

The first part of this document outlines the download and installation
process of the firmware programming software and the required device
drivers.

The second part of this document outlines the firmware upgraded process
using the STM32CubeProgrammer software.

The third part of this document outlines troubleshooting steps.

If you have already downloaded and installed the STM32CubeProgrammer
software, feel free to skip to the [Firmware Update Section](#firmware-update-process).

# Firmware Update Process

This section will walk you through the firmware update process.  The
STM32CubeProgrammer is fairly complex, and it is easy to unintentionally
damage the TNC if the instructions are not carefully followed.

## Download the Firmware File

To start, download the latest firmware for the TNC3 from the [Mobilinkd
Downloads page](http://www.mobilinkd.com/downloads/?dl_cat=6).  The file
will have a ".elf" extension.

## Prepare the TNC

The Mobilinkd TNC3 includes a USB-based DFU (device firmware update) bootloader.

Before we begin, it is helpful to review the TNC3 physical features.

![TNC3 Diagram](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/TNC3_Diagram.png)

The DFU button is used to put the TNC into firmware update mode.

To update the firmware you will need a USB cable with a micro-USB connector.
You will also need a ball-point pen or something that can be inserted into
the hole in the case where the DFU button is.

To enter the bootloader, follow these steps:

 - If you have connected any app to the TNC (APRSdroid, aprs.fi, etc)
   ensure that those apps are disconnected from the TNC.  This is very
   important as having one of these apps attempt to connect to the TNC
   may interfere with the ability to enter the bootloader.
 - Start with the TNC powered off and disconnected from radio and USB.
 - Turn on the TNC.
 - Plug USB cable into the computer.
 - Plug the USB cable into the TNC.  The computer should add a new COM port.
 - Turn the TNC off for a few seconds, then turn it back on.
 - After the blue LED flashes at least once, use the tip of a ball-point
   pen to gently press the DFU button.  You should see the red LED briefly
   flash, and the blue LED will stop blinking.

The TNC is now ready to accept a firmware update.  If you wish to abandon
this process, use the same pen to gently depress the reset button.

## Update the Firmware

In this section we are going to:

 - Start the STM32CubeProgrammer
 - Connect to the TNC's bootloader
 - Load the firmware file
 - Write the firmware to the TNC

### Start the STM32CubeProgrammer

When the STM32CubeProgrammer was installed, it should have put an
application shortcut on your desktop.

![Desktop Icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/FirmwareUpdateGuide/desktop_icon.png)

Find the shortcut and click it.  The firmware update software will start.

![Programmer start](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/FirmwareUpdateGuide/programmer_start.png)

### Connect to TNC

In the upper right, there is a blue and a yellow button.  Press the blue
button to access the drop-down menu and select "USB".

![Select USB](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/FirmwareUpdateGuide/programmer_select_usb.png)

You should see a device named "USB1" available.  If you do not see it, press
the refresh button next to the port selection dropdown.

**If you still do not see a device labeled USB1, press the reset button and
repeat the steps to enter the bootloader.  If you still do not see the
device listed, go the the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.**

Press the yellow "Connect" button to connect to the TNC.  The device's
firmware will be downloaded from the TNC.

![Select USB](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/FirmwareUpdateGuide/programmer_usb_connected.png)

### Load the Firmware File

Click on the "Erasing and Programming" icon on the left side of the
programmer.

![Erasing programming icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/FirmwareUpdateGuide/programmer_erasing_programming.png)

This will bring up the firmware update screen.

![Erasing and programming screen](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/FirmwareUpdateGuide/programmer_erasing_and_programming.png)

Click on the "Browse" button.

![Open file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/FirmwareUpdateGuide/programmer_open_file.png)

Select the firmware file that was downloaded at the beginning of this process.

![Start programming](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/FirmwareUpdateGuide/programmer_start_programming.png)

Ensure that the options "Verify programming" and "Run after programming" are
both enabled.

Press the "Start Programming" button.

![Programming](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/FirmwareUpdateGuide/programmer_programming.png)

When it is complete, the TNC will restart and disconnect from the
STM32CubeProgrammer application.

![Programming complete](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mobilinkd/TNC3/FirmwareUpdateGuide/programming_complete.png)

This warning message is normal.

You can now close the STM32CubeProgrammer and launch the config app on either
Android or iOS and verify that the firmware version is correct.

# Troubleshooting

This section is very brief for now.

## TNC is not available in programmer

There are a number of possible causes for the TNC not showing up in the programmer.

### Is Bootloader Active

The first thing to check is that the bootloader is active.  If the blue LED flashes or breathes,
the bootloader is not active.  See [Cannot Enter Bootloader/DFU](#Cannot-Enter-Bootloader-DFU) below.

### Check Your USB Cable

The TNC has a USB serial port.  You should see a notification when the TNC is first attached via USB,
before entering the bootloader, that a COM port is being added.  If you do not see this occur, verify
that your USB cable is OK.  Try a different cable.  There are a number of "charge-only" cables being
sold these days.  These will not work.  You will need a USB data cable.

### Old STM DFU Driver Installed

Open the device manager.

Check whether “STM Device in DFU Mode” appears under the “Universal Serial Bus Controllers”

If this device appears, right click the device, and select "Uninstall device".

Open a file browser and go to:

C:\Program Files (x86)\STMicroelectronics\STM32Cube\STM32CubeProgrammer\Drivers\DFU_Driver

Run the "STM32Bootloader.bat" file in there to re-install the DFU device drivers.

Refresh the device list in the STM32CubeProgrammer window.

## Cannot Enter Bootloader/DFU

Verify that the TNC's blue LED indicates that the TNC is disconnected by
being in the "slow breathing" state.

If the TNC is connected to any device (blue LED indicating a double blip
or triple blip), the TNC will not enter DFU mode.  Find the app that is
connected and disconnect it.
