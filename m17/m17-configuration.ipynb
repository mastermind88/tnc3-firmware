    "# Mobilinkd M17 Setup Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a guide on how to properly configure and use the Mobilinkd TNC3\n",
    "for M17 voice and data communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes that you will be using the TNC3 with a suitable\n",
    "9600-baud capable radio, and that you have the proper cable to\n",
    "connect the TNC3 to the radio.  It also assumes that you will be\n",
    "using the [M17-KISS-HT](https://github.com/mobilinkd/m17-kiss-ht)\n",
    "Android app for voice communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The guide assumes familiarity with GNU Radio for the M17 receive\n",
    "tests.  And it assumes that you can side-load apps to your Android\n",
    "device.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very much a guide for the experienced experimenter, and not\n",
    "a step-by-step guide designed for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will gladly accept pull requests for added detail for any of the\n",
    "sections below, or for setup hints for specific radio models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Tools\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. An RTL-SDR (TCXO-based, or well-characterized) with antenna.\n",
    " 1. A Pluto SDR with accurate timebase (or other suitable transmit-capable SDR)\n",
    " 1. A Linux-based computer with working sound system\n",
    " 1. The `rtl-sdr` package installed, which contains `/usr/bin/rtl_fm`.\n",
    " 1. [m17-cxx-demod](https://github.com/mobilinkd/m17-cxx-demod) built for Linux\n",
    " 1. GQRX or other GUI-based software for viewing the spectrum by an RTL-SDR\n",
    " 1. A working GNU Radio installation with gr-iio (or sink for your SDR transmitter)\n",
    " 1. Android device running a recent version of Android (10 or greater)\n",
    " 1. The Mobilinkd Config App installed on the Android device\n",
    " 1. M17-KISS-HT installed on the Android device (must be side-loaded)\n",
    " 1. A USB-OTG adapter for the Android device, and an USB cable to connect to the TNC\n",
    " 1. A dummy load\n",
    " \n",
    "Please note that both SDRs will require accurate reference clocks.\n",
    "4-FSK requires reasonably accurate transmit and receive frequencies to\n",
    "be decoded properly.  If your SDR has a 20ppm clock, you can be off by\n",
    "8kHz on 70cm.  It will be impossible to tune the system properly with\n",
    "such an error.  The maximum error that will work is about 500Hz, and\n",
    "less than 100Hz is preferred. That's a 1ppm error, max, at 70cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be connecting to the TNC via USB-OTG rather than over BLE\n",
    "as it been considerably more reliable.  The BLE connection has been\n",
    "unreliable on certain phones and Android versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Tools\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. RF filters for the transmit SDR\n",
    " 1. RF attenuators 20-40dB\n",
    " 1. Spectrum Analyzer\n",
    " 1. Cables and adapters that allow connecting the SDR to\n",
    "    the radio through an attenuator.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be performing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Configure the TX deviation of the TNC/radio pair\n",
    " 1. Configure the TX polarity of the TNC/radio pair\n",
    " 1. Run a TX BERT (bit error rate test)\n",
    " 1. Set up M17-KISS-HT\n",
    " 1. Configure the RX polarity of the TNC/radio pair\n",
    " 1. Run an RX BERT\n",
    " 1. Transmit and receive voice\n",
